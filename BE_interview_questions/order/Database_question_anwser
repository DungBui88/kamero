Sorry, I used to work with spring data and auto-mapping using annotation instead.
I used spring-data-envers for tracking database changes. It's extend the Spring Data Repository with RevisionRepository.
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-envers
Behind the screen it also adding table for tracking entity changes.
The auto entity mapping table of Spring Data will take care the schema changes.
In our case it will not effect the production database as it only adding new fields and tables nor modify any thing.
